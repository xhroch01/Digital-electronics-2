1. Calculate the overflow times for three Timer/Counter modules that contain ATmega328P if CPU clock frequency is 16&nbsp;MHz. Complete the following table for given prescaler values. Note that, Timer/Counter2 is able to set 7 prescaler values, including 32 and 128 and other timers have only 5 prescaler values.

| **Module** | **Number of bits** | **1** | **8** | **32** | **64** | **128** | **256** | **1024** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Timer/Counter0 | 8  | 16u | 128u | -- | | -- | | |
| Timer/Counter1 | 16 |     |      | -- | | -- | | |
| Timer/Counter2 | 8  |     |      |    | |    | | |

2. Shields are boards that can be attached to an Arduino board, significantly expand its capabilities, and makes prototyping much faster. See schematic of [Multi-function shield](../../Docs/arduino_shield.pdf) and find out the connection of four LEDs (D1, D2, D3, D4) and three push buttons (S1-A1, S2-A2, S3-A3).
