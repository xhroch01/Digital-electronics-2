1. Read the [7-segment display tutorial](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/blog/7-segment-display-tutorial.html) and find out what is the difference between:
   * Common Cathode 7-segment display (CC SSD)
   * Common Anode 7-segment display (CA SSD)

2. In the following table, write the binary values of the segments for display 0 to 9 on a common anode 7-segment display.

   | **Digit** | **A** | **B** | **C** | **D** | **E** | **F** | **G** | **DP** |
   | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
   | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
   | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
   | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
   | 4 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
   | 5 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
   | 6 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
   | 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
   | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
   | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
